# remove-pii
Script for assisting in the easy removal of PII from .CSV files

*Only works with .csv at this time*

Instructions

1. run "python no-pii.py" from the terminal

    *It's written in python 3, so remember to use python3 if you don't have an alias set up*

2.  This script is specifically geared to work on our datasets, adding in the ability to clean
    other sets will require a script edit at this time

3. Additionally, this script still can't provide 100% removal of PII.  Some manual quality control
   is still required
